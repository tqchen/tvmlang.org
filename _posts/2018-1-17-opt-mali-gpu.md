With the great success of deep learning, the demand for
deploying deep neural networks to mobile devices is growing rapidly.
Similar to what we do in desktop platforms, utilizing GPU in mobile devices
can benefit both inference speed and energy efficiency. However, most
existing deep learning frameworks do not support mobile GPU very well.
The difficulty lies at the difference between mobile GPU architecture and
desktop GPU architecture. It means special effort is required for optimizing on
mobile GPU. The non-trivial extra work eventually results in the poor support
of mobile GPU in most deep learning frameworks.

TVM addresses the difficulty of deploying for different hardwares by
introducing an unified IR stack, with which the optimization for different 
hardwares can be done easily.  In this post, we show how we use
[TVM](http://tvmlang.org/2017/08/17/tvm-release-announcement.html)/[NNVM](http://tvmlang.org/2017/10/06/nnvm-compiler-announcement.html) to
generate efficient kernels for ARM Mali GPU and do end-to-end compilation.
In our test on Mali-T860 MP4, compared with
[Arm Compute Library](https://developer.arm.com/technologies/compute-library),
our method is 1.4x faster on VGG-16 and 2.2x faster on MobileNet.
Both graph-level and operator-level optimization contribute
to this speed up.

# Mali Midgrad GPU
We will use Firefly-RK3399 with Mali-T860 MP4 as our test environment,
so we mainly focus on Mali T8xx below.

## Architecture
Figure 1 is an overview of the Mali Architecture on T860 and T880.
The GPUs are scalable up to 16 coherent shader cores. Inside each
shader core, there are 2 or 3 arithmetic pipelines, 1 load/store pipeline
and 1 texture pipeline (so-called TriPipe). The ALU in each arithmetic
pipeline has four 128-bit vector units and one scalar units.

We use OpenCL for GPU computing. When mapping to OpenCL model, each
shader core executes one or several work groups. Each shader core supports
up to 384 concurrently executing threads. Each work item in OpenCL
typically maps to a single thread on a Mali GPU.
The Mali GPUs use a VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architecture.
Each instruction word contains multiple operations. The Mali GPUs
also use SIMD, so that most arithmetic instructions operate on
multiple data elements simultaneously. <sup>[1]</sup>

## Difference with NVIDIA's GPUs
Here are some differences that we should concern when writing OpenCL
code for Mali GPUs, compared with writing for NVIDIA's GPUs.
* Mali GPUs use an unified global memory. In NVIDIA's GPUs, we usually
copy data to shared memory, because NVIDIA's GPUs have physically
separate global memory, shared memory and register. In Mali, this copy
does not improve performance and can be removed. Besides, Mali GPUs
usually share the global memory with CPU, so there is no need for copying
between CPU and GPU.
* Mali Midgrad GPUs are based on SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)
and need explicit vectorization. In NVIDIA CUDA, parallelism is
achieved by SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread), which does
not require explicit vectorization. But also notice that the newer
Mali Bitfrost GPUs are based on quad-style vectorization and does not
require explicit vectorization.
* All threads in Mali GPUs have individual program counters. It means
the `warp size` is 1, so that branch divergence is not a major problem.

# Optimization : Convolution as Example
The convolution layer is the core of most deep neural networks and
takes most of the computation time. So we take the convolution layer
as example to demonstrate how common optimization techniques like
packing, tiling, unrolling and vectorization are applied in TVM. 

## Im2Col with GEMM
A well-known algorithm for convolution layer is [im2col](https://petewarden.com/2015/04/20/why-gemm-is-at-the-heart-of-deep-learning/),
which converts the little 3D input cubes to columns of a matrix and 
perform a GEMM. The advantage of this method is easy utilization of 
highly optimized BLAS library.  However, the memory redundancy
(9x memory for 3x3 kernel) is awful.

## Spatial Packing
Instead, we adopt a method to calculate the convolution, and apply the
optimization techniques step by step. A convolution layer in VGG-16 
is used as tuning case, whose configuration is listed below.
We assume the batch size is 1 for inference.

| Input Shape | Output Shape | Kernel Size | Stride | Padding | 
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| 56x56x256   | 56x56x256    | 3x3         | (1, 1) | (1, 1)  |

As a baseline, we also list the performance of this layer in
Arm Compute Library.

| Kernel | Cost (second) | GFLOPS |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| GEMM method in ARMComputeLib | 0.1821 | 20.3111 |

### Declare the computation: tiling and packing
Tiling and packing are two methods intended for better memory access.
Tiling separates the whole computation into small blocks for better
datareuse.  Packing re-layouts the input matrices according to the
tiling so that we can access the memory sequentially, which reduces
cache miss rate.

We do tiling on the width dimension of the input image and CO dimension
of the filter matrix.  This is described by `tvm.compute`.  

``` python
# set tiling factor
VH = 1
VW = VC = 4

# get input shape
 _, CI, IH, IW = data.shape
CO, CI, KH, KW = kernel.shape
TH = IH + 2 * H_PAD
TW = IW + 2 * W_PAD

# calc output shape
OH = (IH + 2*H_PAD - KH) // H_STR + 1
OW = (IW + 2*W_PAD - KW) // W_STR + 1

# data shape after packing
dvshape = (N, TH // (VH*H_STRIDE), TW // (VW*W_STRIDE), CI, VH*H_STRIDE+HCAT, VW*W_STRIDE+WCAT)

# kernel shape after packing
kvshape = (CO // VC, CI, KH, KW, VC)

ovshape = (N, CO // VC, OH // VH, OW // VW, VH, VW, VC)
oshape = (N, CO, OH, OW)

# define packing
data_vec = tvm.compute(dvshape, lambda n, h, w, ci, vh, vw:
    data_pad[n][ci][h*VH*H_STRIDE+vh][w*VW*W_STRIDE+vw], name='data_vec')

kernel_vec = tvm.compute(kvshape, lambda co, ci, kh, kw, vc:
    kernel[co*VC+vc][ci][kh][kw], name='kernel_vec')

# define convolution
ci = tvm.reduce_axis((0, CI), name='ci')
kh = tvm.reduce_axis((0, KH), name='kh')
kw = tvm.reduce_axis((0, KW), name='kw')

conv = tvm.compute(ovshape, lambda n, co, h, w, vh, vw, vc:
    tvm.sum(data_vec[n, h, w, ci, vh*H_STRIDE+kh, vw*W_STRIDE+kw].astype(out_dtype) *
            kernel_vec[co, ci, kh, kw, vc].astype(out_dtype),
            axis=[ci, kh, kw]), name='conv')

# unpack to correct layout
output = tvm.compute(oshape, lambda n, co, h, w:
                     conv[n][co//VC][h/VH][w//VW][h%VH][w%VW][co%VC],
                     name='output_unpack', tag='direct_conv_output')
```

We can inspect the defined IR by
```python
print(tvm.lower(s, [data, kernel, output], simple_mode=True))
```
I pick the convolution part here.
```
produce conv {
  for (co, 0, 64) {
    for (h, 0, 56) {
      for (w, 0, 14) {
        for (vw.init, 0, 4) {
          for (vc.init, 0, 4) {
            conv[((((((((co*56) + h)*14) + w)*4) + vw.init)*4) + vc.init)] = 0.000000f
          }
        }
        for (ci, 0, 256) {
          for (kh, 0, 3) {
            for (kw, 0, 3) {
              for (vw, 0, 4) {
                for (vc, 0, 4) {
                  conv[((((((((co*56) + h)*14) + w)*4) + vw)*4) + vc)] = (conv[((((((((co*56) + h)*14) + w)*4) + vw)*4) + vc)] + (data_vec[(((((((((h*14) + w)*256) + ci)*3) + kh)*6) + kw) + vw)]*kernel_vec[((((((((co*256) + ci)*3) + kh)*3) + kw)*4) + vc)]))
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



### Kernel 1: bind thread
In TVM, we declare the computation at first and then _schedule_ it.
This mechanism decouples the algorithm and implementation detail. (This idea
is from [Halide](http://halide-lang.org/)).

The following schedule simply binds axes to GPU threads, so that
our code can run on Mali GPU.

```python
# helper function for binding thread
def tile_and_bind3d(s, tensor, z, y, x, z_factor=2, y_factor=None, x_factor=None):
    """ tile and bind 3d """
    y_factor = y_factor or z_factor
    x_factor = x_factor or y_factor
    zo, zi = s[tensor].split(z, z_factor)
    yo, yi = s[tensor].split(y, y_factor)
    xo, xi = s[tensor].split(x, x_factor)
    s[tensor].bind(zo, tvm.thread_axis("blockIdx.z"))
    s[tensor].bind(zi, tvm.thread_axis("threadIdx.z"))
    s[tensor].bind(yo, tvm.thread_axis("blockIdx.y"))
    s[tensor].bind(yi, tvm.thread_axis("threadIdx.y"))
    s[tensor].bind(xo, tvm.thread_axis("blockIdx.x"))
    s[tensor].bind(xi, tvm.thread_axis("threadIdx.x"))

# set tunable parameter
num_thread = 8

# schedule data packing
_, h, w, ci, vh, vw = s[data_vec].op.axis
tile_and_bind3d(s, data_vec, h, w, ci, 1)

# schedule kernel packing
co, ci, kh, kw, vc = s[kernel_vec].op.axis
tile_and_bind(s, kernel_vec, co, ci, 1)

# schedule conv
_, c, h, w, vh, vw, vc = s[conv].op.axis
kc, kh, kw = s[conv].op.reduce_axis

s[conv].reorder(_, c, h, w, vh, kc, kh, kw, vw, vc)
tile_and_bind3d(s, conv, c, h, w, num_thread, 1, 1)

_, co, oh, ow = s[output].op.axis
tile_and_bind3d(s, output, co, oh, ow, num_thread, 1, 1)
```

With this schedule, our code can run now, but the performance is terrible.

| Kernel | Cost (second) | GFLOPS | speedup |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| GEMM method in ARMComputeLib | 0.1821 | 20.3111 | 1x    |
| Kernel 1: simple bind | 5.6154 | 0.6588  | 0.03x |

### Kernel 2: unrolling
Loop unrolling can reduce the instructions for loop control, reduce
branch penalties and hide latency in reading memory.
In TVM, this can be done easily by calling `s.unroll(axis)`

```python
# set tunable parameter
num_thread = 8

# schedule data packing
_, h, w, ci, vh, vw = s[data_vec].op.axis
tile_and_bind3d(s, data_vec, h, w, ci, 1)

"""!! ADD UNROLL HERE !!"""
s[data_vec].unroll(vw)

# schedule kernel packing
co, ci, kh, kw, vc = s[kernel_vec].op.axis
tile_and_bind(s, kernel_vec, co, ci, 1)

"""!! ADD UNROLL HERE !!"""
s[kernel_vec].unroll(kh)
s[kernel_vec].unroll(kw)
s[kernel_vec].unroll(vc)

# schedule conv
_, c, h, w, vh, vw, vc = s[conv].op.axis
kc, kh, kw = s[conv].op.reduce_axis

s[conv].reorder(_, c, h, w, vh, kc, kh, kw, vw, vc)
tile_and_bind3d(s, conv, c, h, w, num_thread, 1, 1)

"""!! ADD UNROLL HERE !!"""
s[conv].unroll(kh)
s[conv].unroll(kw)
s[conv].unroll(vw)
s[conv].unroll(vc)

_, co, oh, ow = s[output].op.axis
tile_and_bind3d(s, output, co, oh, ow, num_thread, 1, 1)
```

| Kernel | Cost (second) | GFLOPS | speedup |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| GEMM method in ARMComputeLib | 0.1821 | 20.3111 | 1x    |
| Kernel 1: simple bind | 5.6154 | 0.6588  | 0.03x |
| Kernel 2: + unrolling | 0.3707 | 9.9796  | 0.49x |

### Kernel3: vectorization
As mentioned before, we need to do vectorization explictly
 in order to achieve the best performance on Mali GPU.

```python
# set tunable parameter
num_thread = 8

# schedule data packing
_, h, w, ci, vh, vw = s[data_vec].op.axis
tile_and_bind3d(s, data_vec, h, w, ci, 1)

# unroll
s[data_vec].unroll(vw)

# schedule kernel packing
co, ci, kh, kw, vc = s[kernel_vec].op.axis
tile_and_bind(s, kernel_vec, co, ci, 1)

# unroll
s[kernel_vec].unroll(kh)
s[kernel_vec].unroll(kw)
"""!! VECTORIZE HERE !!"""
s[kernel_vec].vectorize(vc)

# schedule conv
_, c, h, w, vh, vw, vc = s[conv].op.axis
kc, kh, kw = s[conv].op.reduce_axis

s[conv].reorder(_, c, h, w, vh, kc, kh, kw, vw, vc)
tile_and_bind3d(s, conv, c, h, w, num_thread, 1, 1)

# unroll
s[conv].unroll(kh)
s[conv].unroll(kw)
s[conv].unroll(vw)
"""!! VECTORIZE HERE !!"""
s[conv].vectorize(vc)

_, co, oh, ow = s[output].op.axis
tile_and_bind3d(s, output, co, oh, ow, num_thread, 1, 1)
```

| Kernel | Cost (second) | GFLOPS | speedup |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| GEMM method in ARMComputeLib | 0.1821 | 20.3111 | 1x    |
| Kernel 1: simple bind | 5.6154 | 0.6588  | 0.03x |
| Kernel 2: + unrolling | 0.3707 | 9.9796  | 0.49x |
| Kernel 3: + vectorization    | 0.1304 | 28.3679 | 1.40x |


### How to set the tunable parameter
As for the tunable parameters above, some can be calculated.
For the vectorized dimension `VC`, we should fill the 128-bit register,
so it can be set as 128/32=4 for float32 and 128/16=8 for float16.

But more often we cannot determine the optimal value, due to the
complicated runtime. We use grid search in TVM. It can be
done extremely effective since we write python code in TVM's high-level
IR rather than direct OpenCL code.


### The generated OpenCL code
We can view the generated OpenCL code by
```python
print(func.imported_modules[0].get_source())
```
The OpenCL code is too long to be pasted here, and it is hard to read due
to heavy unrolling. If interested, you can view it
[here](https://github.com/merrymercy/tvm-mali/blob/master/data/kernels.cl).

# End-to-End Benchmarking
In this section, we compare the comprehensive performance between
different backends on some popular deep neural networks.
Our test environment is

```
Firefly-RK3399 4G
CPU: dual-core Cortex-A72 + quad-core Cortex-A53  
GPU: Mali-T860MP4 

Arm Compute Library : v17.12
MXNet: v1.0.1
Openblas: v0.2.18
```

We use NNVM and TVM to do end-to-end compilation.


## Performance

![image](/images/opt-mali/end2end.png/){: width="95%"}
{:center}

<center> Figure 2. Inference Speed of Different Backends on ImageNet</center> <p></p>

As shown in Figure 2, we test the inference speed on ImageNet.
On Firefly-RK3399, Mali GPU can be 2x ~ 4x faster than 6-core big.LITTLE CPU.
Our end-to-end pipeline is 1.4x ~ 2.2x faster than Arm Compute Library.
We try both GEMM and direct method of convolution layer in
Arm Compute Library, GEMM method is always faster than direct method
in these test cases, so we only plot the result of GEMM method.

Some results, like resnet18 on Arm Compute Library, are missing in the Figure 2.
It is because the graph runtime of Arm Compute Library does not support
skip connection currently and has a poor neon implementation of
depthwise convolution.  This also reflects the advantage of NNVM
software stack.

## Half-Precision Performance
Precision in deep neural networks is not very important, especially 
for the inference on mobile devices. Using low-precision arithmetic
can make the inference much faster. We also test the half-precision
floating number on Mali GPU.

| model | backend | Time Cost per Image (second) | speed up to FP32 |
| -------| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| vgg16         | ACM-mali | 0.9694 | 1.69 |
| vgg16         | TVM-mali | 0.6896 | **1.87x** |
| MobileNet 1.0 | TVM-mali | 0.0479 | 1.60x |
| ResNet18      | TVM-mali | 0.1183 | 1.73x |

<center> Table 1. Inference Speed of FP16 on ImageNet</center> <p></p>

In theory, FP16 can both double peak compute and halve memory consumption,
so that doubling the speed. But it needs good input shape for
longer vectorization and fine-tuning some parameters.

## Further Work on Mobile Devices
We should admit that there is still some room for improvement, 
mainly at the graph level, such as model compression and weight prelayout.
Further improvement in NNVM will try to solve these problems.
