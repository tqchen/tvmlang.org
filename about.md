# About TVM

TVM is an open deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs and specialized accelerators.
It aims to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks,
and the performance- or efficiency-oriented hardware backends.
Checkout our techreport [TVM: End-to-End Optimization Stack for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04799)

TVM stack began as a research project at the [SAML group](https://saml.cs.washington.edu/) of
Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington. The project is now driven by an open source community involving multiple industry and academic institutions.
The project adopt Apache-style contributing model and governs by merit.
